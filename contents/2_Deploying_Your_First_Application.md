## Getting Jitsu ( The Nodejitsu Command Line Tool )

The easiest way to start using Nodejitsu is to download our CLI ( Command Line Interface ) tool, Jitsu. With Jitsu you will be able to easily deploy and manage your Nodejitsu applications from the command line. Jitsu is very friendly to non-techinical users, but it's also fully open-source for the more advanced node.js user.
