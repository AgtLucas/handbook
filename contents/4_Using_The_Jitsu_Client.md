# Using The Jitsu Client

Jitsu is a Command Line Tool (CLI) for interacting with the Nodejitsu platform. It's open-source and easy to use. We've designed Jitsu to be suitable for command line beginners, but still be powerful and extensible enough for production usage. If you aren't a fan of the command line, you can still pretty much do everything Jitsu can do through our web interface, Samurai.
