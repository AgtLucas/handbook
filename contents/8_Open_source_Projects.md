## Why open-source

A lot of Nodejitsu's technology stack is released as open-source software. We choose to do this for many reasons. Aside from being able to give back to the very awesome Node.js community, releasing pieces of our stack as open-source allows other developers and users to review and improve our software. We've already received invaluable contributions to our platform from developers who would have never seen our code if we had not open-sourced. 
    
## Where to find

Nodejitsu hosts it's open-source projects on Github.com. Github is website for sharing and collobrating on source code.
