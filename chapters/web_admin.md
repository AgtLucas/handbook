# Nodejitsu Web Application

The Nodejitsu Web Application allows developers to administrate their
applications through a web interface. This interface allows access to all the
same functionality that can be found in [jitsu](#jitsu) or the [JSON API](#api),
including deployment, snapshots and database connectivity.
