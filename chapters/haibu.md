# Haibu

<!--TODO: Go through a Haibu install, flesh out the docs!-->

<!--basically a copy-paste job from the haibu docs-->
`haibu` is the open-source node.js project for spawning and managing several
node.js applications on a single server. It's an integral part of Nodejitsu's
production stack and is fully supported by a dedicated team of core node.js
developers.

<!--
This is what's *interesting* about haibu, and why it's documented here. I want
to really drive this home.
-->
By installing `haibu`, a user creates a development environment for themselves
that mirrors the functionality of Nodejitsu's cloud platform.

<!--
This is a stub, mostly because haibu's documentation is still "in the works"
from what I can tell.
