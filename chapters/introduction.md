So you wish to learn the ways of Nodejitsu? Excellent! Reading this sentence is

You only need to know 3 things to get started:

* We're Nodejitsu, and we can give you scalable, fault-tolerant cloud hosting
for your Node.js apps - and we're the best you'll find.

* Our entire stack is [open source](http://github.com/nodejitsu) and you can use
our tools anywhere else you'd like to.

* Getting started with [your first app](#Deploying_Applications) is [simple](#Using_The_Jitsu_Client) with our Jitsu command-line interface.
