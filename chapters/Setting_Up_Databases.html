<h1>Setting Up A Database For Your Application</h1>
<p>Nodejitsu has several Node.js friendly databases ready to be used by your application. If you have already have a database running, Nodejitsu can connect to your pre-existing database. If you require a new database, Nodejitsu can provide you FREE instances of several different types of databases. These free instances are great for development purposes or hobby sites. If you require a high traffic or production database, we provide an easy upgrade path with our partners such as Redis2Go, CouchOne, and MongoHQ.</p>
