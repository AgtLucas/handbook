# Using Databases

Applications on Nodejitsu are ready to be connected to any database. If you have already have a database running, Nodejitsu can connect to your pre-existing database. If you require a new database, Nodejitsu can provide you FREE instances of several different types of databases. These free instances are great for development purposes or hobby sites. If you require a high traffic or production database we provide an easy upgrade path to industrial strength database hosting.

## Creating new Databases

If you require database hosting, you can create a new database instance of any of our supported databases using Samaruai, Jitsu, or our API.


## Existing Databases

If you already have an externally hosted Database, Nodejitsu is capable of connecting to it. We've got Database hosting if you need it, but we fully support externally hosted Databases. Feel free to drop us an email if you have any questions.

## Connecting Applications to Databases

If you want to connect a Database to your Node.js application, Nodejitsu provides you with sample code for each Database type as well as the ability to specify database connection strings in your application's package.json
