# Using The Jitsu Client

[Jitsu](http://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu) is a [Command Line Tool (CLI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for interacting with the Nodejitsu platform. It's open-source and easy to use. We've designed Jitsu to be suitable for command line beginners, but still be powerful and extensible enough for production usage. If you aren't a fan of the command line or don't have terminal access, you can still do everything Jitsu can do through our web admin, [Samurai](#Samurai). 

## Installation

     [sudo] npm install jitsu
     
## Usage

     jitsu help
     
Jitsu is mostly self-documenting. For additional resources you can visit it's source code repository located @ [http://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu](http://github.com/nodejitsu/jitsu).
