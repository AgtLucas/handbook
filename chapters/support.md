<a name='support'></a>

Nodejitsu has a team of developers standing by to assist users with any issues
they may come across while deploying and administrating their web applications
on the Nodejitsu platform. Nodejitsu strives to have a lightning-fast
turnaround on all issues you may have!

## Assistly

Our [Assistly](http://nodejitsu.assistly.com/) support center is a great
resource! Our support center includes a knowledge base where you can search for
the information you need, but if you can't find what you're looking for our
support center also allows users to post questions to Nodejitsu's support staff
using Assistly's "Q&A" feature. Post a question, and one of our ninjas will
get back to you at ninja speed!

## E-mail

If you have issues, you can always contact us via email, at
**[support@nodejitsu.com](email:support@nodejitsu.com)**.

## IRC

Nodejitsu has a channel on [freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/) at
(irc://freenode.net/#nodejitsu)[irc://freenode.net/#nodejitsu], where Nodejitsu
developers are standing by to support users around the clock. Drop by to ask
questions, get assistance or even just to hang out!

## Github Issues

Each of Nodejitsu's open source projects uses Github Issues to manage bugs and
related software problems. Github Issues is most useful for developers. For
example, if a developer finds a bug in our open-source
[http proxy](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy), they can submit an
issue at <https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/issues> and tell us about
their bug.
