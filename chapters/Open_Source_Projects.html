<h2 id="Why-open-source">Why open-source</h2>

<p>A lot of Nodejitsu's technology stack is released as open-source software. We choose to do this for many reasons. Aside from being able to give back to the very awesome Node.js community, releasing pieces of our stack as open-source allows other developers and users to review and improve our software. We've already received invaluable contributions to our platform from developers who would have never seen our code if we had not open-sourced it.</p>

<p>Releasing as open-source increases the quality of our software.</p>

<h2 id="Where-to-find">Where to find</h2>

<p>Nodejitsu hosts it's open-source projects on <a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a>. Github is website for sharing and collobrating on source code. You can get source code without creating an account, and if you want to create an account it's free. You'll need a <a href="http://gitscm.org/">Git</a> client if you wish to check out any of our code repositories.</p>

<p>You can visit our open-source project directory at: <a href="http://github.com/nodejitsu" data-bare-link="true">http://github.com/nodejitsu</a></p>

<h2 id="How-to-contribute">How to contribute</h2>

<p>Anyone can contribute to any Nodejitsu open-source projects at anytime. <a href="http://github.com/nodejitsu">Github</a> has the facilities for managing patches, issues, code comments, version control, etc. If you aren't ready to submit code or have questions you can create a Github issue or even just send an email to the Node.js mailing list. We'll make sure one our Ninja's gets back to you soon.</p>
