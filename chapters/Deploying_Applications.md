## Deploying from the Samurai web admin

The Samurai web admin is an easy to use web-site where you can manage and deploy your node.js applications. Simply visit www.nodejitsu.com and sign-in. You'll be taken directly to the Samurai web admin interface.

## Deploying from Jitsu, The Nodejitsu Command Line Tool 

If you prefer CLI ( Command Line Interface ) tools over web-sites you can download Jitsu, The Nodejitsu CLI tool. Jitsu is friendly to non-technical users, but it does cover our entire [API](API) and it's fully open-source for the more advanced node.js user.

## Deploying from the API

If you are an advanced user, you might want to automate your deployment using scripts instead of manually deploying your application using Samurai or Jitsu. Nodejitsu provides a high-level JSON API which will allow you to deploy applications, as well as many other features.
