# Deploying Applications

There are a few options for how you can deploy your Application to Nodejitsu.

## Deploying from the Samurai web admin

The Samurai web admin is an easy to use web-site where you can manage and deploy your Node.js applications. Simply visit [http://www.nodejitsu.com](http://www.nodejitsu.com) and sign-in. You'll be taken directly to the Samurai web admin interface.

## Deploying from Jitsu, The Nodejitsu Command Line Tool 

If you prefer a CLI ( Command Line Interface ) instead of a web-site you can download [Jitsu](#Using_The_Jitsu_Client), The Nodejitsu CLI tool. Jitsu is friendly to non-technical users, but it does cover our entire [API](#API) and it's fully open-source for the more advanced Node.js user. 

## Deploying from the API

If you are an advanced user, you might want to automate your deployment using scripts instead of manually deploying your application from Samurai or Jitsu. Nodejitsu provides a [high-level JSON API](#Using_The_API) which will allow you to deploy applications as well as many other features. 

You can see a detailed specification of the [high-level JSON API](#Using_The_API) here.
