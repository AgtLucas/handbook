# Deploying Applications


We've got three basic ways to deploy your application. 

- [Jitsu](#Using_The_Jitsu_Client), The Nodejitsu Command Line Tool 
- [Samurai](http://nodejitsu.com), An easy to use Web Admin
- The [API](#Using_The_API), A high-level JSON API


If it is your first time deploying an application and you are eager to get started, we recommend that you try out [Jitsu](#Using_The_Jitsu_Client), our CLI tool. Jitsu has a one line installer, it's self-documenting, and you'll be able to deploy your app in seconds.
