# Deploying Applications

If it is your first time deploying an application, we recommend that you try out [Jitsu](#Using_The_Jitsu_Client), our CLI tool. We also offer a web interface and API for deploying applications. 

## The Samurai web admin

Samurai is an easy to use web admin where you can manage and deploy your Node.js applications. Just visit [http://www.nodejitsu.com](http://www.nodejitsu.com) and sign-in. You'll be taken directly to the Samurai web admin interface.

## Jitsu, The Nodejitsu Command Line Tool 

If you prefer a CLI ( Command Line Interface ) instead of a web-site you can download [Jitsu](#Using_The_Jitsu_Client), The Nodejitsu CLI tool. Jitsu is friendly to non-technical users, but it does cover our entire [API](#Using_The_API) and it's fully open-source for the more advanced Node.js user. 

## The API

If you are an advanced user, you might want to automate your deployment using scripts instead of manually deploying your application from Samurai or Jitsu. Nodejitsu provides a [high-level JSON API](#Using_The_API) which will allow you to deploy applications programmatically. 

You can see a detailed specification of the API [here](#Using_The_API).
